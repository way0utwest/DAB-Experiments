# DAB Experiments
This repository contains a collection of experiments using the [Data API Builder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-api-builder/overview), which is designed to simplify the process of building APIs for data sources. This works cross platform and cross data store.

You can read more about this in the [Data API Builder Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-api-builder/).

## Simple Talk
This folder contains a few versions of the dab-config.json file that I used to write various articles on [SQL Server Central](https://www.sqlservercentral.com/) and on my [blog](https://voiceofthedba.com/).

The first article is [here](https://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/getting-started-with-the-data-api-builder).
