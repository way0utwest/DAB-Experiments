<h1>Redgate Flyway Advanced Features</h1>
<p>Redgate Flyway is a powerful tool for managing database migrations. It provides a range of advanced features that can help you streamline your development process and ensure that your database schema is always in sync with your application code.</p>
<p>Some of the advanced features covered today are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Static Data:</li>
    <li>Code Analysis</li>
    <li>Drift Detection</li>
    <li>Change Reporting</li>
    </ul>
Each of these is covered in more detail below.</p>
<h2>Static Data</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Also called lookup or reference data​</li>
    <li>Static data is often used to populate checkboxes, drop downs, or radio buttons​</li>
    <li>Values are usually the same in development and production​
        <li>Flyway can track tables with this data​</li>
        <li>Flyway automatically detects changes​</li>
        <li>Data changes are captured and stored in version control​</li>
        <li>Changes are deployed along with other schema changes​</li>
</ul>
<h2>Code Analysis</h2>
<p>Code analysis is a powerful feature of Redgate Flyway that allows you to analyze your database code for potential issues before you deploy it. This can help you catch bugs and performance issues early in the development process, saving you time and effort in the long run.</p>
<p>With code analysis, you can check for things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unused objects</li>
  <li>Missing indexes</li>
  <li>Potential performance issues</li>
  <li>Code style violations</li>
<h2>Drift Detection</h2>
 <p>Drift detection is another powerful feature of Redgate Flyway that allows you to detect changes to your database schema that have not been captured in your migration scripts. This can help you ensure that your database is always in sync with your application code, and can help you avoid issues caused by manual changes to the database.</p>
<p>With drift detection, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Detect changes to your database schema</li>
  <li>Compare your database schema to your migration scripts</li>
  <li>Generate reports on drifted objects</li>
  <h2>Change Reporting</h2>
  <p>Change reporting is a feature of Redgate Flyway that allows you to generate reports on changes to your database schema. This can help you keep track of changes made to your database over time, and can help you identify potential issues before they become problems.</p>
<p>With change reporting, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Generate reports on changes to your database schema</li>
  <li>Track changes made to your database over time</li>
  <li>Identify potential issues before they become problems</li>
</ul>
